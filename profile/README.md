## Welcome!

- Feel free to open new issues in any of the project for discussions


### Where should my issue go?

This is mainly for group members

- For ntuple generation, use [`lhcb-ntuples-gen`](https://github.com/umd-lhcb/lhcb-ntuples-gen)
- For setting up new projects involving `nix`, or request new `nix` packages, use [`root-curated`](https://github.com/umd-lhcb/root-curated)
- For `nix`-based user config on our server (`glacier`), use [`server-user-config`](https://github.com/umd-lhcb/server-user-config)
